/*   variables
In JavaScript, a variable is a named storage location for data. 
You can think of it as a container that holds a value.
 Variables are used to store and manipulate data in your programs.*/

//var (older way, still works):
var variableName = value;

//let (used for variables whose values can be reassigned):
let variableName = value;

//const (used for variables whose values should not be reassigned):
const variableName = value;
